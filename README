XML/DifferenceMarkup version 0.01
=================================

This module implements an XML diff producing XML output. Both input
and output are DOM documents, as implemented by XML::LibXML. The
output format is meant to be human-readable (i.e. simple, as opposed
to short) - basically the diff is a subset of the input trees,
annotated with instruction element nodes specifying how to convert the
source tree to the target by inserting and deleting nodes.
